Turtle Art 3D Javascript Prototype
==================================
A 3D, javascript/WebGL based implementation of the turtle Blocks Activity.
Link to the Preview : http://ishan28mkip.github.io/turtleBlocks3D

How to run
----------
Everything is similar to the turtle Blocks js version. Only the turtle commands have changed to incorporate the
3D functions. These commands are explained below:

1. setPositionX,Y,Z : Sets the X,Y,Z coordinate respectively.
1. setPosition : Sets the X,Y,Z coordinate together in a three argument block.
1. forwardX,Y,Z : Move along the X,Y,Z axis respectively.
1. setRoll : Sets the rotation angle about the X axis in degrees.
1. setPitch : Sets the rotation angle about the Y axis in degrees.
1. setYaw : Sets the rotation angle about the Z axis in degrees.
1. doRoll : Rotates about the X axis in degrees.
1. doPitch : Rotates about the Y axis in degrees.
1. doYaw : Rotates about the Z axis in degrees.

Problems
--------

1. Camera change is not yet possible.
1. The coordinate axis is rotated by default, y axis pointing in the default z axis direction.
1. Erase does reset the cursor position but does not erase the drawn lines.


Next Version Features
----------------------
1. Add camera position change support.
1. Fix the erase button. (Add support to erase the lines)
