###This is the old version
Turtle Art 3D Javascript Prototype
==================================
A 3D, javascript/WebGL based implementation of the turtle Blocks Activity.
Link to the Preview : http://ishan28mkip.github.io/turtleBlocks3D/

How to run
----------

### Modes

On running the prototype there is a prompt for the mode of execution. `0 : CUI mode`, `1 : Manual Mode`. In the CUI mode the code can be written text area which will be excuted. While in the Manual mode keys control the cursor, its rotation and block placement.

### CUI mode

Chose `0` in the initial prompt.

List of Variables that can be modified
---------------------------------------
1. `positionStepX` : Changes the step value for the cursor movement along X axis `(Pixels)`.
1. `positionStepY` : Changes the step value for the cursor movement along Y axis `(Pixels)`.
1. `positionStepZ` : Changes the step value for the cursor movement along Z axis `(Pixels)`.
1. `rotationStepRoll` : Changes the step rotation value of the roll. `(Degrees)` 
1. `rotationStepPitch` : Changes the step rotation value of the pitch. `(Degrees)` 
1. `rotationStepYaw` : Changes the step rotation value of the yaw. `(Degrees)` 


List of Supported Commands
--------------------------

1. `shiftCursorPositionX(direction)` ; Move `positionStepX` distance about its x axis direction. direction `1` would be positive x axis, `-1` would be negative x axis. Similar commands exist for Y & Z axis.
1. `setRoll(degree)` ; Specify the value of roll in `degrees`. Similar commands exist for setting Pitch, Yaw.
1. `rotateRoll(degree)` ; Roll the cursor/object `rotationStepRoll` degree. Similar commands exist for incrementing or decrementing the Pitch and Yaw.
1. `CreateCurrentObjectAtCursor` ; inserts the current block (material & geometry) selected at the centre and in the orientation of the cursor.

Examples
--------

An example is already present in the text area when the website loads.

Problems
--------

1. The script text area is given eval access. This leads to big security concerns. Next iteration would lead to a better implementation without eval.
1. Graphical Scripting is not yet implemented.

### Manual Mode

Chose `1` in the initial prompt.

List of commands that are available
------------------------------------
1. `Arrow keys` to move in the X-Y plane.
1. `]` key to move in the positive z direction & `[` to move in the negative z direction.
1. `r` to set the roll.
1. `p` to set the pitch.
1. `y` to set the yaw.
1. `i` to insert block at the current position.
